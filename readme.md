Developer, Designer, Baker
----------------------------
I&rsquo;m a coder and designer with a background in book publishing and marketing. After
several years working for independent book publishers in London & dabbling in web design,
I wanted to improve my coding and refocus my career and enroll in the [Makers Academy course](https://github.com/abridger/makers-academy-course).

When not coding, designing, doodling or taking photographs, I&rsquo;ll almost certainly
be baking bread.


Current Projects
