Developer. Designer. Part-time Baker.
-------------------------------------
I&rsquo;m a coder and designer with a background in book publishing and
marketing. After several years working for independent book publishers in London
and dabbling in web design, I wanted to improve my coding and refocus my career,
so I decided to enroll in the [Makers Academy course](https://github.com/abridger/makers-academy-course)
&ndash; an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp. Now a Makers Academy graduate,
I&rsquo;m looking for a career in development. When not coding, designing,
doodling or [taking photographs](https://500px.com/AlanBridger), you&rsquo;ll almost certainly find me baking
bread.
